## Integration with Vue Router:
1. Define Routes: defined in index.js found in router folder
```
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home },
  { path: '/about', component: About },
]
```
2. Configure Router:
```
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
import { routes } from './routes'; // Import your routes

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const router = new VueRouter({
  routes,
});

new Vue({
  router,
}).$mount('#app');

```
* Imports VueRouter from the Vue Router library.
* Imports your defined routes from the separate file (./routes).
* Registers Vue Router as a plugin using Vue.use(VueRouter).
* Creates a new VueRouter instance with the routes configuration.
* Creates a new Vue root instance, associating it with the created router using router.
* Mounts the Vue application to the element with the ID #app in your HTML.

* the <router-view/> component serves as a placeholder where the content of the currently active route will be displayed. When a user navigates to a specific route defined in your router configuration, the content associated with that route is rendered inside the <router-view/> component. This ensures that the appropriate content is displayed based on the current route.

```
<template>
  <div>
    <header>
      <router-link to="/">Home</router-link>
      <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
    </header>
    <main>
      <router-view />
    </main>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { /* Your routes */ } from './routes'; // Import your routes

export default {
  // ...
  routes, // Include routes in the component's options
};
</script>

```
